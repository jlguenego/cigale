# Cigale

A set of CSS setting increasing the usability of HTML tags.

## Why Cigale?

Cigale, in english Cicada. It is an kind of insect that lives in the south of France, and who does 'ksssksssksss'... or 'csscsscss'... yes this play on word sucks... :smiley:

## Motivations

HTML default settings sucks:
- buttons design too old. Not minimalist. Not flat
- radio button and check button too small
- input type=text should be homogen with buttons.
- No concept of primary button.
- No choice of color palette.
- Form should often be the same things.
- Mobile first : vertical layout.
- Responsive menu.
